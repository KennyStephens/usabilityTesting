## Usability Testing Server
This is a school project designed to create a website and database that will allow users to easily create usability tests and send them to people.
User should be able to do the following:

* Submit a link for a page that they want tested
* Submit a number of items they would like completed when they are testing
* Have a URL that will show them feedback on the website

## Codepen links

* [mouse tracking](https://codepen.io/riderjensen/pen/xaRNEy)


## CDN Tracker Alternative

* Create a script that people put on just one page
* We pull the page once
* Then anyone who goes on there just simply gets tracked and only the data is sent
* Most of this code is already written in our recMove.js
* On an exit event, we send information over to DB so that we know when they left the page and what they did before they left
